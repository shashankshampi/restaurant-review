# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

For the Restaurant Reviews projects, I converted a static webpage to a responsively-designed web application with service worker caching for offline capabilities.

### Prerequisites

You need to have installed node.js server to run the app.

```
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
```

### Installing and running the app

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Node.js has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Node just run `http-server`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8080`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code.
